# python-newsfeed

## Description

A simple app that allows people to post website links. Users can then upvote or comment on the post. It is a retooling of a previous app I built using JavaScript and Node, with Python and Flask replacing those technologies. There are many limitations, and the use is simple, but all functionality from the previous version has been maintained.

A live version of the app can be found on [Heroku](https://simple-tech-news-py.herokuapp.com/).
